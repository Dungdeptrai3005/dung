<p> If I have spare time, I would like to playing video games with my friends or cooking.</p>

</ul> 
<h2> Interest in IT </h2>
<p> The reason I choose for my major is that I have a strong favor about computer when I was very young. 
I found it is very interesting to know how applications can run on the computer 
<br> as well as learning to run a web in order to help my parents company. 
However, I haven't have any specific knowledge about web programming or coding so I hope RMIT will help me<br>to
improve my skills so that I can follow my dream. </p>
